## About this theme

This is a porting of [sticko](http://sticko.apps.runkite.com/), a clean, modern, **responsive** and **free** theme for the emerging -and absolutely amazing- blogging platform called [Sculpin](http://sculpin.io).

I really hope you like it and feel free to use this theme for whatever purpose you want.

### Features
* Full responsive.
* Lightweight yet beautiful.
* Google+ Comments on Posts.
* Off-canvas navigation.
* Author info outside loop across the whole theme.
* Loading indicator.
* Icon fonts - support for Retina Display/High pixel density screens.
* SCSS source files for further modifications.

### Installation

Sculpin can automatically install this theme for you by adding the following to
your `sculpin.json`:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "git@github.com:mavimo/sculpin-theme-stickio.git"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "mavimo/sculpin-theme-stickio": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

Then execute sculpin update, this download and move theme in the right folder.

To enable the theme for the current site edit the ``Ã pp/config/sculpin_kernel.yml``` file and add:

```
sculpin_theme:
  theme: mavimo/sculpin-theme-sticko
```

### Configuration

This theme support a large set of configurations, all this will be placed in ```sculpin_site.yml```. You can copy and change values from the following sample:

### Editing CSS/SCSS files.

**Sticko** is developed on top of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install), which means that you are going to need both running on your own machine; follow both guides to set up the proper environment.
